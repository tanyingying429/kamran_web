# Getting Started with Kamran React.js App
The web site is written in React.js.

Note: node version should be 14.x.x.\
You can install the node version by using nvm.
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
